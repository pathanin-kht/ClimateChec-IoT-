# **ClimateCheck IoT** 
## Overviews
ClimateCheck is my first IoT project at Khon Kaen University, developed between December 2022 and March 2023. It tracks temperature and humidity in a room, sending Line notifications when user-defined limits are exceeded. It helps detect fires by alerting users if the temperature surpasses 57Â°C. Data is stored in Google Sheets and can be analyzed in Looker Studio with daily summaries of average and peak temperatures.

## Technologies Used
- **IoT Device:** ESP32

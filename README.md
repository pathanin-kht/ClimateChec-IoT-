# ClimateCheck IoT 
## ClimateCheck is a device that tracks temperature and humidity in a room, sending Line notifications when user-defined limits are exceeded. It helps detect fires by alerting users if the temperature surpasses 57Â°C. Data is stored in Google Sheets and can be analyzed in Looker Studio with daily summaries of average and peak temperatures.
